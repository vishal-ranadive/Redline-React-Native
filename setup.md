# üöÄ React Native Android Setup & Build Guide

This guide provides step-by-step instructions to set up, build, and manage a React Native project for **Android**.

---

## üß± 1. Create a New React Native Project

You can create a new project using either the **React Native Community CLI** or the **default CLI**.

### Option 1 ‚Äî Using Community CLI

```bash
npx @react-native-community/cli@latest init MyNewProject
```

### Option 2 ‚Äî Using Default React Native CLI

```bash
npx react-native init MyApp
```

> üí° **Tip:** Replace `MyNewProject` or `MyApp` with your preferred project name.

---

## üì± 2. Build & Run the Android App

### Step 1 ‚Äî Navigate to the Android folder

```bash
cd android
```

### Step 2 ‚Äî Clean Gradle build

```bash
./gradlew clean
```

### Step 3 ‚Äî Go back to the project root

```bash
cd ..
```

### Step 4 ‚Äî Run the Android app on an emulator or connected device

```bash
npx react-native run-android
```

> üß© **Tip:** Make sure an Android emulator or a physical device is connected and recognized using:
>
> ```bash
> adb devices
> ```

## üßπ 3. Clean Cache & Reinstall Dependencies

When facing build or dependency issues, follow this full clean-up process.

### Step 1 ‚Äî Remove Gradle caches and build folders

```bash
rm -rf android/.gradle
rm -rf android/build
rm -rf android/app/build
```

### Step 2 ‚Äî Remove node modules

```bash
rm -rf node_modules
```

### Step 3 ‚Äî Reinstall npm dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

> üß† **Alternative:** If you‚Äôre using Yarn
>
> ```bash
> yarn install
> ```

---

## üß∞ 4. Verify Environment & Troubleshooting

Before running your app, make sure your development environment is properly configured.

### Run Environment Doctor

```bash
npx react-native doctor
```

* It checks Android SDK, Java, Node, Watchman, etc.
* Follow suggested fixes for any ‚ÄúX‚Äù or warnings shown.

### Windows Path Tip

Keep your project folder close to the root (e.g., `C:\Projects\MyApp`) to avoid:

* **CMake/Ninja long path errors**
* **Gradle path too long** issues

---

## üé® 5. Adding Icons (Vector Icons)

React Native uses **react-native-vector-icons** for scalable icons.

### Installation

```bash
npm install react-native-vector-icons
```

### Example usage

```js
import Icon from 'react-native-vector-icons/MaterialIcons';

<Icon name="home" size={30} color="#000" />
```

### Official Docs

üëâ [https://oblador.github.io/react-native-vector-icons/](https://oblador.github.io/react-native-vector-icons/)

### Example Dependency in `package.json`

```json
"react-native-vector-icons": "^10.3.0"
```

## üß≠ Notes & Best Practices

* Always run `./gradlew clean` inside the `android/` folder after:

  * Moving the project
  * Changing SDK or Java versions
* Keep Gradle, Node, and React Native versions compatible.
* Run the app at least once via CLI before using Android Studio‚Äôs Run button.
